# 🎵 Music Genre Classifier (MEAN Stack)

A web application to classify music/audio files into their respective genres using a Machine Learning model. Built using Angular for the frontend and Express + Python for the backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV)
- Predict the genre using a pre-trained ML model
- Clean, colorful UI inspired by music platforms
- Built with Angular standalone components
- File upload + backend integration with Python

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular (Standalone), TypeScript, SCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Multer
- **ML Model**: Python (custom genre classifier)
- **Others**: CORS, HTML5, Custom Styling
